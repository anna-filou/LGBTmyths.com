title: Why are LGBT people so vocal about their sexuality / identity? 
short: You likely have very different standards as to what you perceive as vocal when it comes to LGBT people vs straight/cis ones. If a man and a woman kiss in public, you might not even notice. But if it’s two men, they’re “provocative”.
