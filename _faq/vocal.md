title: Why are LGBT people so vocal about their sexuality / identity? 
short: You likely have very different standards as to what you perceive as vocal when it comes to LGBT people. A man and a woman kissing in public might not grab your attention, but two men doing the same are “provocative”.

*“I’m fine with people being gay, as long as they don’t go out their way to tell me about it.”*

I’ve heard similar statements many times. The thing is, people are just living their lives but you *perceive* them as making everything about their sexuality. 

You see a man wearing a dress and you say “Why did he wear that? Can’t he keep his sexual preferences private?” But wearing a dress doesn't inherently reveal anything about one's sexuality. That's just your interpretation. If you saw a woman wearing a dress, it's unlikely you'd assume she's trying to broadcast her heterosexuality through her clothing.

What you’re really saying is “I don't want people to act contrary to what I expect based on their appearance”. To which my response would be, “**Why&nbsp;not**?”
