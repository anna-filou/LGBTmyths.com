title: I don't even know any LGBT people, why should I care?
short: Around 8% of people globally identify as LGBT. Considering the real number may be larger (as people are often afraid of disclosing that their sexuality is anything but straight), **it's very likely that someone in your close circle is&nbsp;LGBT+**.

“Bullshit,” I hear you saying, “everyone I know is straight!” 

[Contrary to stereotypes](/look-same), many LGBT people don't “look gay.” Have you considered that your best friend, your sibling, your child or even your partner might be bisexual or trans and never told you because they fear you'll react negatively? 

Prove them wrong.
