title: I don't even know any LGBT people, why should I care?
short: About 5% of people in the West identify as LGBT. Considering that the real number must be larger (as people are often afraid of disclosing that their sexuality is anything but straight), **it's very likely that someone in your close circle is LGBT+**.

“Bullshit,” I hear you saying, “everyone I know is straight!” 

[Contrary to stereotypes](/look-same), many LGBT people don't “look gay.” Have you considered that your best friend, your sibling, your child or even your partner might be bisexual or trans and never told you because they fear you'll react negatively? 

Prove them wrong.
