title: You are either straight or gay. Bisexual people are just confused.
short: Although some bisexual people may later identify more strongly with either “gay” or “straight,” this doesn’t mean that those attracted to people of different sexes and gender identities are confused. Even if someone’s sexual orientation changes over time, that doesn’t make their initial attraction any less real or valid.
