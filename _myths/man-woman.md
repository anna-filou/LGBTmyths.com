title: A man cannot become a woman
short: “Woman” can mean `A.` a human born with ovaries, or `B.` the social construct which dictates how these humans should behave. If you say “a man cannot become a woman,” you‘re using definition `A`. If you disagree, you’re going by definition `B`.

**There’s a running joke these days where someone asks a “leftist” what a woman is, and they cannot reply.**

When trans-supporting and anti-trans people argue, the entire argument is often built on a misunderstanding. Each side thinks that the words man and woman mean completely different things than what the other side does. If you look at the dictionary, it defines woman as an “adult human female,” but does not define that. In biology, **a human female is a person born with ovaries**, and no testicles. Vice versa for men. Simple.

Now the problem arises because there is another definition of “man” and “woman,” which is what we mostly use in our everyday life.

If someone says “you’re not a **real man**!” they‘re not literally claiming that you weren't born with testicles, but rather that you don't *act* the way in which society dictates that people with testicles *should* act. Similarly, if somebody says “**real women** have curves” they don’t think that if you're not curvy, you were surely not born with ovaries. They mean “I believe it's socially desirable for people born with ovaries to have curves.”

**There can never be an agreement, if we don't first agree on what the words we use mean**. It's come to be that a single word, “woman,” means both “human born with ovaries” and “the societal role that humans born with ovaries are expected, encouraged and sometimes forced to play.”

If you were wondering, I’d define the social variant of the words man and woman as “a person who, if made to choose which societal role, that for those born with testicles or ovaries, is closer to the way they want to live their lives, they’d pick the role for those with `{ testicles or ovaries respectively }`.”
