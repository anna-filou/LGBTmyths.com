If you’re straight, do you think I could “convince” you to “become gay” with something I say? If you strictly like women, do you think that anything short of a magical potion could make you *feel* romantically and sexually attracted to men? 

If you’re screaming HELL NO in your head, you get it. 

There’s nothing anyone could tell or show you that would change who you’re fundamentally attracted to. 

We all grasp this intuitively. We’ve had crushes in elementary school, before we even knew what to call them. We’ve met people who took our breath away at first sight. We’ve felt the urge—the *need*—to be close to the person we like; to become one with them, even. 

Do you truly believe that you can talk anyone into feeling those things? That you can *groom* them into feeling love, infatuation, butterfies in their stomach or a desire to grow old with a specific person?

Because that’s exactly what you’re insinuating when you say you worry that gay people will turn your kids gay.
