title: You can become gay by associating with gay people.
short: There’s no evidence for that. We don’t know what “makes” a person gay, just like we don’t know what makes someone straight. But, hanging out with people who are open about being LGBT could help someone who’s afraid to come out to do so, hence the misconception.
