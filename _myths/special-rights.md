I’ve heard the following “arguement” a few times, in a country were gay marriage is not legal:

> “I’m a straight man, and I only have the right to marry a woman. If a gay man wants the right to marry another man, then he’s asking for special rights”.

How would it be a special right, if everyone will have the right to marry someone of the same sex?

More importantly, claiming gay and straight people have marriage equality because “the rules are the same for everyone” is entirely missing the point. If only heterosexual marriage is legal, then a straight man can marry the love of his life (if she’s willing), but a gay man never could — therefore the situation is&nbsp;unequal.
