## Why did you make this?

Online arguments on the topic of LGBT rights often cascade into a heated back-and-forth of personal attacks.

I imagined a resource that debunks misconceptions in a polite and understanding way, as you might try to explain to your prejudiced—but actually kind—relatives.

A link that you can post under ignorant comments on social media to educate, without wasting time and effort to gather references from the ground up, or sanity to argue about your right to live freely.
